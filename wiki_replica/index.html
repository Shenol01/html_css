<h1>Micrometre</h1>

<hr>


<p>
  The <b>micrometre</b> (International spelling; American spelling: <b>micrometer</b>), symbol <b>µm</b>, 
  is a unit of length in the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units (SI)</a>
  equal to <b>10<sup>−6</sup> metre</b> (one millionth of a metre).The nearest smaller common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI unit </a>is the nanometre, equivalent to one thousandth of a micrometre, one millionth of a millimetre or one billionth of a metre (0.000000001 m).
  The micrometre is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared radiation as well as sizes of biological cells and bacteria,[1] and for grading wool by the diameter of the fibres.[2] The width of a single human hair ranges from approximately 20 to 200 μm.

<h2>SI Standatisation</h2>

<p> 
The term micron and the symbol μ were officially accepted for use in isolation to denote the micrometre in 1879, but officially revoked by the International System of Units (SI) in 1967.[8][9] This became necessary because the older usage was incompatible with the official adoption of the unit prefix micro-, denoted μ, during the creation of the SI in 1960.
In the SI, the systematic name micrometre became the official name of the unit, and μm became the official unit symbol.
In American English, the use of micron may help to differentiate the unit from the micrometer, a measuring device, because the unit's name in American spelling is a homograph of the device's name. In spoken English, they are distinguished by pronunciation, as the name of the measuring device is stressed on the second syllable (/maɪˈkrɒmɪtər/ my-KROM-it-ər), whereas the unit name places the stress on the first syllable (/ˈmaɪkroʊmiːtər/ MY-kroh-meet-ər).[10]
The plural of micron is normally microns, though micra was occasionally used before 1950.

<h2>Symbol</h2>

<p>
  The official symbol for the SI prefix “micro-” is the Greek lowercase letter mu (μ).  
  Unicode includes both <b>µ</b> (micro sign, U+00B5) and <b>μ</b> (Greek small letter mu, U+03BC).  
  The Greek letter is preferred by the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode Consortium</a>.Before desktop publishing became commonplace, it was customary to render the symbol μ in texts produced with mechanical typewriters by combining a slightly lowered slash with the letter u. For example, "15 μm" would appear as "15/um". This gave rise in early word processing to substituting just the letter u for the symbol if the Greek letter μ was not available, as in "15 um".[15]
  The Unicode CJK Compatibility block contains square forms of some Japanese katakana measure and currency units. U+3348 ㍈ SQUARE MIKURON corresponds to ミクロン mikuron.

<h2>Terminology and Standardisation</h2>

<p>
  The term “<b>micron</b>” and the symbol “µ” were officially accepted in 1879 but later 
  replaced by the standard SI term <b>micrometre (µm)</b>.  
  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American English</a>, 
  “micron” is still sometimes used to avoid confusion with the measuring device called a 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometer">micrometer screw gauge</a>.
